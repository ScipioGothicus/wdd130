                <h2>Q: How long have you been programming for?</h2>
                <p>About ten years! I've done programming ever since I was 10 years old. I started out primarily with C#, but quickly moved on to other languages like Python and Java. Learning C# came from wanting to learn how to use the game engine Unity. I didn't make much progress, unfortunately, so I would actually consider my first programming language to be Python. I used Java in school and learned it in a lot more depth from an AP computer science class I had in my senior year of high school.</p>

                <h2>Q: What are your hobbies and talents related to computers?</h2>
                <p>Well, obviously, I enjoy programming the most. But I have a variety of other talents! I do graphic design and video editing, both of which I used in my mission and in an internship I held a couple of years ago. I like creative writing (I know it's not super related to computers, but I use one to write sometimes?). I play video games and enjoy indie games over the massively multiplayer genre. I also build my own computers! I set up a computer tower that I put together msyelf as an Apache web server, game server, and file locker all at once. It was a fun learning experience!</p>
