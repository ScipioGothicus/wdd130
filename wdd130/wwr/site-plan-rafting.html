    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This site is being built to better advertise and promote our rafting business, Raftaholic. It saves on a lot of paper and lets us update and distribute deals and offers with the click of a button and a few lines of code! Also, this generation seems to be constantly glued to their phones... so why not take advantage of that fact by going online!</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>We're focusing the most on the teens and young adults of our era to find this website and join the Raftaholics! Anyone with some free time and a love for rafting or swimming is our target audience. We want you to be as sold as we are on the fun and excitement of rafting, especially our rafting style here at Raftaholic! If you're looking for a fun and engaging rafting challenge, look no further than Raftaholic! On a side note, we've made this site fully accessible by desktop and mobile device, though we've put our priority on smartphones, since our target audience has an affinity for handheld devices.</p>
