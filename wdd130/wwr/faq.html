            <h2>Q: How much does it cost to go on a tour?</h2>
            <p>Rates for adults are $12 per person. Children 13 and under are $5. All children 13 and under must be accompanied by a person 18 or over. Group tours are discounted at $8 per adult and $2 per child if the group has 10+ people.</p>
            <h2>Q: Is whitewater rafting safe?</h2>
            <p>Whitewater rafting is completely safe, as long as all rules and guidelines are followed as set by Raftaholics! Our tour guides will be with you throughout the entire tour if you have any concerns or questions. Also, please remember: ALWAYS wear your life vest/floatation devices! They WILL save your life in the rare case of the raft ejecting passengers and/or flipping. Our tour guides will ensure that all party members are properly wearing their life vest for each tour.</p>
            <h2>Q: Do I need to bring any supplies with me?</h2>
            <p>It is highly recommended to bring your own towels and sunscreen with you. Please do not take these with you on the tour. Instead, leave them in your car so that you are able to use them before/after the tour. If you forget anything, Raftaholics provides towels, sunscreen, sunglasses, and refreshments for sale.</p>
